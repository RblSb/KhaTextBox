# KhaTextBox
A TextBox with selection, scrolling and cut/copy/paste functionality built on-top of Kha.

Please see the `TODO.txt` for the list of items complete/incomplete. If you wish to contribute, please update the TODO for any features you have implemented. Items that are complete are indicated with the hypen at the start.

Currently, there are several items in the TODO requiring refactoring, including scrolling and break-behaviour to correctly implement single-line functionality.

## Project's Future
I do not intend to implement all the functionality you see in the TODO list, at least not in terms of those items available in the Desirable Features section. The reason for this is because I intend to migrate much of this code-base into the [Twinspire](https://github.com/twinspire/Twinspire) video game engine, and working on two of essentially the same project is rather pointless. Twinspire does not use the object-oriented approach that most game engines use except on the occasion where it is necessary.

If there is a feature you want implemented, especially those under the Desirable Features list, and it has not been implemented yet, feel free to make a pull request.
