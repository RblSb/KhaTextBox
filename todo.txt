### Core Features ###
- Blinking caret
- Highlight and selection capabilities with mouse and keyboard.
Common hotkey implementations, including Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, and Ctrl+X, for copy, paste and cut, respectively.
  * CTRL+A to select all (@tienery assigned)
  * CTRL+D to deselect (@tienery assigned)
- Holding Ctrl with arrow keys should increase caret index on a per word basis.
- Word-wrapping functionality
- key-repeat
Make the textbox scroll to where the caret is when typing.

### Issues ###
Don't make unneccessary `drawCharacter` calls if the text to render is outside the range of the TextBox. (efficiency)

### Desirable Features ###
Holding shift and clicking somewhere in the TextBox should highlight the text to that index.
- Make scrollbar disappear if the text does not need scrolling.
